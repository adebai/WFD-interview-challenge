## Problems

1.  This app has default authentication enabled. You need to alter the code to
	- disable the registration form and restrict self-registration.
	- enable role-based authentication. The app needs to have below roles
		- **admin**
		This is the root user and has access to the entire application. The admin user can add more users, delete / ban users.
		- **supervisor**
		This is a regular user and has the ability to add / bulk upload / view the referrals.
		- **executive**
		This is a regular user and has the ability to view the referrals. However, they can add comments on the referrals. (A separate table needs to be created for storing the comments. Comments will be visible to all users)

2. Currently, the view referrals section has filters on country and city (filters are visible only if there are more than one countries / cities)
We need enable search / filters on all columns so that the executives are able to quickly search down the data.
You need to alter the code to make the view referrals interface better ( Use your creativity )
